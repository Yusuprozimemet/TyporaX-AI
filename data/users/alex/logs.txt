The Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group primarily living in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwestern China. Their history dates back over two millennia and includes distinct phases of nomadic empire-building, such as the Uyghur Khaganate (744–840 AD). Originally, the Uyghurs inhabited oases in the Tarim Basin along the Silk Road, where they developed a rich culture influenced by Buddhism, Manichaeism, and later Islam, which became the dominant religion by the 10th century. They have a significant heritage of art, language, and traditions tied to Central Asia. Today, the Uyghurs maintain a strong cultural identity but have faced political and human rights challenges in modern times, particularly under Chinese government policies. They are known for their distinct language, customs, and historic role in trade and culture along the Silk Road.
