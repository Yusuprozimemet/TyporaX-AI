# TyporaX-AI Testing Plan 

The Testing Plan helps you design small experiments to test your business idea. Instead of guessing, you will collect real evidence from customers.

1. Define your hypothesis  
What do you want to test?  
H1: Learners are stuck at B1 and cannot move to B2/C1 because they lack real, deep, natural conversations at the right level.  
H2: AI-initiated Dutch podcast conversations that users can join and engage in real time.  
H3: Real-time assessment with “Better Version” corrections actually helps users improve during the same session.  
H4: PWA desktop experience increases daily usage. (phone version not clear yet)  
H5: Generating personalized study plan based on MBTI and ancestry background (optional – not implemented yet).  
H6: Auto-generating lessons, flashcards, typing/pronunciation practice from the conversation (not implemented yet).  
H7: Live assessment of writing (not implemented yet).  
H8: Community feature where users can connect and talk to each other (not implemented yet). 
H9: users will generate their own expert based on the context. (not implemented yet) 
Note: I am open to any advice from users.

2. Define success criteria  
How will you know if your test is successful?  
- if most of the testers say the real-time “Better Version” feedback helps them improve in the same session.     
- Clear ranking of which future features they want most.

3. Plan your experiment  
What kind of test will you run? Interview, landing page, prototype demo, survey, pilot session, etc.  
quick 1-on-1 prototype demo + real-time podcast conversation + structured interview and survey.  
At the same time, a simple landing page will be launched on Reddit and expat groups to measure waitlist sign-ups.

4. Identify resources needed  
What do you need to run the test? People, tools, budget, time.  
Volunteer testers (12–18), Zoom Pro, demo accounts, screen & audio recording (with consent), Google Forms, simple landing page, €10–15 thank-you vouchers per tester, technical support person on standby, total budget ≈ €200–250.

5. Define timeline  
When will you run the test? Choose specific dates (start & end).  
December 2 2025 (first demo, internal test), then I will think about preparing landing page for external testers. 


6. Capture results  
After running the test: Record what happened in the Results column.  
(to be filled after December 8)

7. Adjust & next Steps  
(to be filled after results)


PLANNING MY TEST - Summary  
Summary of my test plan  
Test whether learners stuck at B1 Dutch find an AI-initiated interactive podcast and specialized experts with real-time feedback engaging, helpful, and worth paying for.

WHY am I testing?  
To confirm that the main problem for Dutch learners in the Netherlands is getting stuck at B1 level because most apps offer wide but shallow content and no real conversation practice at the right depth. This test will prove if TyporaX-AI solves that exact pain.

WHAT am I testing?  
All the features that I could prepare.


WHO are my testers?  
Describe your tester audience (What are their characteristics)  
Dutch learners living in the Netherlands who have been stuck at B1 level for 6+ months, age 25–45, need Dutch for work or integration.

How many testers do you need? as many as possible.
How will you recruit them:  
r/learndutch, r/Netherlands, Dutch learners Facebook groups, LinkedIn “Nederlands leren” groups, expat communities, taalcafés, personal network


PLANNING MY TEST - Planning the testing day  
WHEN will my test be?  
Date December 2–8, 2025     

WHERE am I testing?  
Onsite for now, later remote, I will think about it. 

WHO is my audience?  
Serious Dutch learners, Dutch learners who stuck at B1 level and cannot hold real conversation easily.

HOW am I going to test?  
My test setup will be…  
15-minute individual/group session:  
- 5 min intro + consent  
- 10 min quick demo  


What do you need to have ready on the day?
A demo, Google Form, 
Important message to the testers: Any kind of support—online or offline, with or without funding—is very welcome.

What do you want to measure?  
- Confirmation of “stuck at B1” problem  
- Conversation naturalness & depth fit  
- Perceived immediate improvement   
- Willingness to pay  
- Ranking of future features

What tools are you going to use to capture feedback?  
Zoom meeting, Google Forms, 

WHAT help do I need?  
finding more testers


PLANNING MY TEST - Results  
What I learned about my customer?  

What I learned about my idea from the test?  

What I will improve based on the test?  

New ideas the test gave me:  

What went well and what should I improve on the testing?  

Was the measurements I created applicable?  

Shall I plan another testing event? Which elements will be important to have on it?
